# AI Gomoku Agent

# Description
<p>This project implements Google Deepmind AlphaZero's method to create Gomoku game agent.<br>
Gomoku is an abstract strategy board game using Go pieces and board. The first player to form a connected line of 5 stone in either vertical, horizontal, or diagonal direction wins.<br> 
Training process is repeated using Deep Learning method and player can play with the AI agent based on the model trained.

# Getting started
<p>
You can train the model by running train.py. After prompting for an input model, it will train from scratch if input number is 0 or import model from save/train if model number is specified. For example, if you want to import train_5000.pickle, you'll input 5000 when prompted.<br>
You can also play Gomoku game with trained AI model by running play.py. Just like training, you'll be prompted for model number to import model from save/model.

# Methodology
* Policy Network<br>
  Policy Network learns a definite output value with a given input value. In this project, the network calculates the expected reward value of actions with an input board state. Policy is used for MCTS traversal and updated every iterations.
* Monte-Carlo Tree Search<br>
  MCTS is a search algorithm for solving Markov Decision Problems. Since problems like Gomoku has enormous scale of state domain, it is nearly impossible perform a tree search through all states. Instead of searching through all paths, MCTS performs random playout until game is over. After performing sufficiently number of iterations, MCTS can determine the expected win-rate of each nodes.
* Training with self-play<br>
  Policy network is trained using only play data generated by self-play. In case of AlphaGo and AlphaZero, AlphaZero showed better performance though it did not use any play data from human games.
